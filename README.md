## 📌 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the IEEE AI/ML/DL Internship Program.

The application predicts whether a patient is at risk of diabetes using Machine Learning classification techniques based on health parameters provided by the user.

The system accepts the following inputs:

* Number of Pregnancies
* Glucose Level
* Blood Pressure
* Skin Thickness
* Insulin Level
* BMI
* Diabetes Pedigree Function
* Age

The application then provides:

* Diabetes Risk Prediction
* Probability Score
* Risk Level
* Health Recommendations
